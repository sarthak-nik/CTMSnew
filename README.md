# Cricket Tournament Management System - CTMS

This project is a simple Cricket Tournament Management System.

This software would store and manage information related to a cricket tournament such as the teams, players, match details and statistics.

The relevant entities for this project are - players, teams and matches.

The software would store details of players which can be of different roles - bowler, batsman, wicket-keeper, all-rounder such as their name, age, left-handed/right-handed and details specific to their role like fast bowler/spin bowler etc.

The software involves storing a lot of information (for which using a database is important) and computing various statistics and summaries.

For simplicity in the project, the data is generated randomly rather than manually entering all the information.

The software would store team details - like team name, list of players, captain etc.
The software would also store details regarding each match which would include - the two teams, match result (which team won), which team batted first and details like runs scored and balls faced by each player, wickets taken and overs bowled by each player etc.

For the tournament, match schedule is generated in a round-robin system where each team faces every other team once.

## The use cases are -
1. Randomly generate player and team details.
2. Generate match schedule in round robin manner.
3. View a player’s statistics. This would include the basic player details like their name, age,
team and would include tournament statistics like runs scored, strike rate, average, wickets taken etc.
4. View a team’s statistics. This would include matches played, total matches won, highest run-scorer, highest wicket-taker, last 5 match results.
5. View a match’s scorecard.
6. View tournament statistics - five highest wicket takers, five highest run scorers etc.
